## Challenges
I encountered some problems when trying to deploy the shiny r app. I realized that it was because I was using Google Shell instead of using an R IDE to deploy it. I got around this by deploying it directly on posit.cloud. I also encountered some issues when deploying my shiny python app. First, it was because I forgot to include a requirements.txt, which I quickly fixed. Then, when I successfully deployed the app and clicked on the url, the window shows that there was an error and that the application exited before accepting connections. I couldn't figure out where the error was, so I just refreshed my page and redeployed it. Then, the deployment failed and I got an error in the terminal that says `Application deployment failed with error`. Again, I refreshed the page, and redeployed it. The terminal says that the deployment was successful and the url worked this time.

## Insights and Patterns
Because I used similar codes when formatting the visualizations, the UI interface looks similar for each method.
