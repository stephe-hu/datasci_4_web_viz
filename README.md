## Python Shiny Visualization: ![Screenshot 2023-09-25 231609](https://github.com/stephe-hu/datasci_4_web_viz/assets/123779806/77cb0681-5764-4882-be62-d623813b16a2)

## Challenges
I did not encounter any major technical challenges with the assignment. I did encounter some minor challenges when trying to format the visualizations to the way I want. I was able to resolve them after some trial and error and by referring to the class examples and textbook.

## Insights and Patterns
I noticed that the code for formatting the visualization of the data is similar between the options (python flask, shiny python, and shiny r). This results in the UI interface also being similar.
